# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.
> And install packages.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
npx react-native start

```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android app:

### Android

```sh
npx react-native run-android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio.
